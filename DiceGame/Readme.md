# Dice Game

This is a simple dice game created using **Kotlin**
where the user competes against the CPU, the
first one to reach the score of 10 wins. 

## Description:
This project is all about **Dice Rolling game app in android studio with animation**.     
In this project we have created a simple android app in which dice will roll on click with simple animation.  
In this project you will learn how to work with images and how to work with android animation.
       
   ### Working:
       -> In this project we have built a simple dice roller game app.  
       -> We have displayed our dice as images in an ImageView.  
       -> When we click on it,we generate a random number between 1 and 6   
          and then show the results by setting the appropiate dice image 
          on our ImageView with the setImageResource method.
       -> one dice will be operated by the computer and another by the user, 
          as soon as the user taps roll and he gets a number   
          the computer's dice also rolls and gives a number.  
       -> whoever gets a higher number their points get increased by 1
          and the first one to reach the score of 10 wins the game.
